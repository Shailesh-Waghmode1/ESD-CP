- Access granted if valid

### 📘 Book Issuance
- Scan book RFID tag
- If available, book is issued and Firebase is updated
- Issue date and book details shown in mobile app

### 📙 Book Return & Fine
- Scan book tag
- Fine calculated based on due date
- Status updated in real time
- Fine shown in app, payment possible
